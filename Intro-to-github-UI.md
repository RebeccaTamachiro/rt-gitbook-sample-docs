# Intro to the GitHub user interface

The GitHub website brings together a number of different features. As a consequence, its interface is populated with access to all of them but the content available depends on each user and their particular use.

This topic and the ones nested under it cover general navigation and specificities of some of the commonly accessed areas in GitHub: personal dashboard, repositories and projects.
